# Eagle Personal Libraries

This repository contains my personal Eagle libraries. They contain all parts I regularly use, parts I've created from scratch or have adapted to better suit my needs.

# Credits

I try to keep track of all shoulders I stand on (besides the standard libraries shipped with Eagle).

If you feel I've used your work and have not given you (enough) credit, please just let me know and we'll fix that right away ;-)

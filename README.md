# Eagle Personal Libraries

This repository contains my personal Eagle libraries. They contain all parts I regularly use, parts I've created from scratch or have adapted to better suit my needs.

# Credits

I try to keep track of all shoulders I stand on (besides the standard libraries shipped with Eagle). Credits go to:

* raspberrypi_bastelstube_v13.lbr by eightbit from [https://cadsoft.io/resources/libraries/](https://cadsoft.io/resources/libraries/)
* [https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries)

If you feel I've used your work and have not given you (enough) credit, please just let me know and we'll fix that right away ;-)
